# WOHI-finalproject
Web-programming I course project, a study site infused with a funny Keanu Reeves API and an insult generator.

The main idea is the calendar, with the pomodoro-style timer with the famous lofi-girl stream embedded in to the site.
It also features a snake game that was developed in a side assignment with an AI-teacher. It was for the lecturer's research
about the effects of coding directly with an AI-teacher in web development.

The project summed up the use of React and Node.js, learning JavaScript and using Bootstrap and Bootswatch ready-made components and themes.
We also practiced using API's and in this project all credit for the data goes to Alexander Sandberg and you can find it <a href="https://placekeanu.com">here</a>
Another one used was an insult generator and you can find it <a href="https://insult.mattbas.org">here</a>

AI was used during the development to help with debugging and learning the JavaScript and React-framework basics.
