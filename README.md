This project uses Node.js and is made with React.

You need to have Node.js installed. When launching the project you need
React-Bootswatch npm package as the project uses the Morph layout and style.
We also use the modal from bootstrap, and react-router-dom to use the screen availability.

The API's are free and as of October 2025 work without an api key
